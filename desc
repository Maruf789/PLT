As platform component

Given:
data search query

I want to
export matching data into H5 file stored on HDFS and notify (if provided) on exporting finish.

As a labeling manager, I want to have a platform capability that will export data to H5 format for data selected for manual labeling

H5 format spec is attached

Definition of done:
Data selected for labelingÂ is exported to H5 format, max file size 1GB (request for bigger files exist as well)
Exported data is stored on the platform
Once export is finished, H5 data is accessible using labeling tool data download API
