BuckCal User Test Folder

This is the folder for the convenience of user to compile and run BuckCal program.

./compile.sh <main buckcal source file> <output executable name>

Note:
Only the main executable buckcal file should be provided to the script, imported files should present, but their names are not required for compile.sh.
buckcal_lib.bc has to be present when used, but it does not have to be copied by user, the script will do that
