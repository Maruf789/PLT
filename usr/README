BuckCal User Test Folder

This is the folder for the convenience of user to compile and run BuckCal program.

./compile.sh <main buckcal source file> <output executable name>

For example, for to compile and then run the sample.bc file, type these following two commands:
./compile.sh sample.bc sample.bin
./sample.bin

Note:
Only the main executable buckcal file should be provided to the script, imported files should present, but their names are not required for compile.sh.
buckcal_lib.bc has to be present when used, but it does not have to be copied by user, the script will do that
